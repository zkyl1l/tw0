The Soul Stone even has a pocket dimension within it called Soulworld. Soulworld consists entirely of shallow water underneath a dim orange sky, where the souls of the dead can be communicated with.</td>

Due to its power, it can only be held by beings of exceptional superhuman ability. The sorcerer Agamotto was only able to safely harness the stone's power after encasing it in a special containment device known as the Eye of Agamotto.</td>

When allowed to influence an average human it will inevitably kill them, as evidenced by Jane Foster. The Reality Stone's power is such that it can affect reality on a universal scale.</td>

            <td>As the Infinity Stone that embodies both the sustaining and destructive forces of the universe, the Power Stone grants its wielder tremendous energy manipulation capabilities. Due to the amount of energy the Power Stone releases, it is the most destructive out of all the Infinity Stones in terms of raw power. Like all Infinity Stones, the Power Stone is among the most powerful artifacts in the universe, with only beings of an extraordinary constitution being able to use it while less powerful beings would erupt in a violent explosion. The more powerful the being is, the longer it takes for the Power Stone to destroy.</td>
